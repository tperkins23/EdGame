I plan on making a 2D educational game based around simple spelling or math. The success of questions increase players position to reach a "finish line". I plan on create a variety of levels based on ability or grade level. I may make the game play differ with options of "racing" or "game success" playing options.
Adding additional line to see changes when uploading to Github.

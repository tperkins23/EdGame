I plan on making a 2D educational game based around simple spelling or math. 
The success of questions increase players position to reach a "finish line". 
I plan on create a variety of levels based on ability or grade level. 
I may make the game play differ with options of "racing" or "game success" playing options.

2/10/20 Week: Learning to create events and object coding in GameMaker by following a tutorial to make a simple astroid game.
After completing the tutorial I will begin intergrating movement into my game.

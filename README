I plan on making a 2D educational game based around simple spelling or math. 
The success of questions increase players position to reach a "finish line". 
I plan on create a variety of levels based on ability or grade level. 
I may make the game play differ with options of "racing" or "game success" playing options.

2/10/20: Learning to create events and object coding in GameMaker by following a tutorial to make a simple astroid game.
After completing the tutorial I will begin intergrating movement into my game.

2/13/20: Continued working through tutorial. I will begin to transfer code knowledge into the EdGame upon finishing the tutorial.

2/25/20: I have completed the selection screens including home, level, and difficulty. In addition I have started to work with how 
to use a path feature for the movement of the player.

3/3/20: I have completed the movement of the player and computer runners. Starting to work on the display and comparison of player input values. 

3/5/20: Completed the first rough copy of the game the basic features work but I will need to go back in and clean up so aspects and possibly
look into adding more features.

3/9/20: Retested functionality and found that within every level the same questions pop up in the same order which is not dsired. 
Added a list of problems to work on to appear on both the win and loss screens to show users what questions they got wrong.

3/10/20:Game Completed ... Also added in division and may push multiplication over to the division script to make it more useful for student practice.

3/26/20: After having third party testing found that if the input contained no numbers the game would error out. I added a 
few lines of code to handle that error and have not had any error outs since.
